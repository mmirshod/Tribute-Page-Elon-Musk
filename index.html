                <li>In 2000, he merges with his rival start-up Confinity to form PayPal</li> 
                <li>Later that same year, he got ousted from PayPal as a CEO (while on honeymoon). Regardless of that, Musk continues to invest money in it</li> 
                <li>In 2001, Elon moved to LA to be closer to the space industry and learned how to build rockets from books</li> 
                <li>In 2002, after finding out that rockets are overpriced, the ambitious entrepreneur started Space X and got 250M from sale of PayPal</li>
